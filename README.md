
Custom static site generator. 

Main aims:

* No frontmatter - taints the markdown
* No folder structure - creates other awkardness in ordering and placement
* No special file naming - forces metadata into file or folder structure

Ideas:

Hardcode header, footer, css. 
Create list of `.md` files to copy from elsewhere in folder structure
Concatenate header, foreach `.md`, convert to HTML, append, finally add footer. 


Privacy Policy, OS licenses, license can stay where they are

FAQs, Screenshots, can live in assets folder.
