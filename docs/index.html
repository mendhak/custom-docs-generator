<p><strong>New location</strong> - if you are at a new location after a long flight, the GPS on your phone can take a while to reorient itself. Try running GPSLogger at high frequency until it does find a location.</p>
<p><strong>Interference</strong> - there may be structures nearby blocking your signal.</p>
<p><strong>Mid flight</strong> - if you are in a commercial aircraft, you are probably traveling too fast for your phone&#39;s hardware to keep up with the GPS signals.</p>
<p>You can read more a little more on what&#39;s involved <a href="pages/gps-fix-details/">here</a></p>

</div></section>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whyarethefixessometimesinaccurate" href="#whyarethefixessometimesinaccurate">Why are the fixes sometimes inaccurate?</a></h2><p>It all comes down to your hardware, settings and environment. The accuracy is only as good as your phone&#39;s GPS chip. Some phones may have 4 meter accuracies, some have 500 meters. Also, using GPS satellites will give you better accuracy but take a longer time; using network location will give worse accuracy but is quicker. You may also want to check your environment, as there can be inaccuracy due to clouds, buildings, sunspots, alien invasion, etc.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="mytimeintervalhaspassedbutnopointwaslogged" href="#mytimeintervalhaspassedbutnopointwaslogged">My time interval has passed, but no point was logged</a></h2><h2><a name="sometimestheappwillnotlogforlongperiodsoftime" href="#sometimestheappwillnotlogforlongperiodsoftime">Sometimes, the app will not log for long periods of time</a></h2><p>Sometimes your specified time interval will have passed, but no point was logged.  There are a few reasons this could happens. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The GPS system will have attempted to find its location and given up after a while. This in turn means that Android OS will not have given a location to GPSLogger</p>
</li>
<li><p>The accuracy was below your <em>Accuracy filter</em> settings, or the distance was below your <em>Distance filter</em> settings, so GPSLogger didn&#39;t log it. You can try setting a <em>retry interval</em> in which GPSLogger can wait for a more accurate point to show up and then use it.  Or you can allow for slightly more inaccurate fixes - your mileage may vary as every phone is different in terms of how accurate a fix it can get on a regular basis. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally, on Android 6+ (Marshmallow), a new feature called <em><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html">doze mode</a></em> was introduced, which severely restricts activity on the device after certain periods of inactivity. You can choose to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/stop-specific-apps-from-using-doze-on-android-6-0-marshmallow/">whitelist GPSLogger</a> which does not bypass doze mode but occasionally provides logging windows in which to work. It will not make a great difference though, doze mode is quite aggressive.</p>

</ul>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="itsusingthewrongtimezonecanyoumakeitusemytimezone" href="#itsusingthewrongtimezonecanyoumakeitusemytimezone">It&#39;s using the wrong timezone, can you make it use my timezone?</a></h2><p>The standard when logging points is to use UTC. Since this is the standard, it would be wrong to use the the local time zone, the file is considered invalid. Instead, it is the responsibility of the software you use the log file on (Google Earth, GeoSetter, etc.) to adjust for your timezone. Any application that deals with GPX or KML files will have a setting that allows you to specify your own timezone.</p>

<p>The imperial units are only for display purposes and nothing else. However, when logging, the units are always in <strong>SI units</strong> - meters and seconds.</p>

How do I get to it?</a></h2><h2><a name="whatisthedefaultfolderpath" href="#whatisthedefaultfolderpath">What is the default folder path?</a></h2><p>Due to recent restrictions, the default GPSLogger folder is different per device. You can see it on the simple/detailed screens and it may be something like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/</code></p>
<p>Example: <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial part will be different for your device. </p>
<p>If you have a file explorer installed, you can click on the folder paths in the simple/detailed screens.</p>
<p>To copy the GPSLogger files, you can connect your phone to your computer and mount the SD card, then copy straight from the above folder. You can also change the default folder in the app settings. </p>
<p>Finally, note that due to the <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/09/storage-situation-removable-storage.html">restrictions introduced in Android KitKat</a>, any files in the default folder will be removed if you uninstall the app.</p>

This means that if you&#39;ve set your interval as 1 hour, you have a long wait ahead of you. If you want the changes to take effect immediately, then stop logging and start it again so that the changes are refreshed.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whatdothevarioussettingsmeanaccuracyretryintervalforaccuracyetc" href="#whatdothevarioussettingsmeanaccuracyretryintervalforaccuracyetc">What do the various settings mean? (Accuracy, retry interval for accuracy, etc)</a></h2><p><img src="images/7b.png" alt="7b"></p>
<p><strong>Time before logging</strong> - How long to wait after a point has been logged to try logging again.</p>
<p><strong>Distance filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this much distance exists between the previous and current points. If it isn&#39;t this distance, the point is discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this point has a minimum accuracy specified. If it does not match the specified accuracy, the point is discarded. This is useful if you are inside a building for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Time interval for accuracy</strong> - When searching for a point, the app can continue searching for this many seconds until it finds a point that meets the accuracy and distance filter criteria above.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute timeout</strong> - When searching for a point and trying over and over, the app will give up when this timeout is reached.  This is useful for when you&#39;re inside buildings, GPS tends to keep searching and finding nothing.  </p>
<p><strong>Keep GPS on between fixes</strong> - Normally, the app stops using GPS between points, to save battery.  This means when it&#39;s time to log the next point, the GPS needs to be &#39;woken up&#39; again and this takes a little time.  Keeping GPS on between fixes causes this &#39;wake up&#39; time to be reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t log if I&#39;m not moving</strong> - Some Android phones come with activity recognition; the app can use this to determine if you are not moving and if so, it will not attempt to log a point. </p>

<p>If you turn mobile data off, you&#39;ll probably want to inject aGPS data regularly, there are apps that can do it for you. You can also try going into airplane mode which turns many things off. </p>
<p>When it comes to choosing between <em>location sources</em> - GPS vs network - GPS will be more battery hungry, but has better accuracy; network location is easier on the battery but isn&#39;t as accurate.</p>
<p>For <em>time intervals</em>, consider using 60 seconds or more.</p>

</div></section>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="theappdoesntlogatexactlyemxemsecondsasivespecified" href="#theappdoesntlogatexactlyemxemsecondsasivespecified">The app doesn&#39;t log at exactly <em>x</em> seconds as I&#39;ve specified</a></h2><p>It&#39;s how the Android OS has implemented its GPS system. When you say you want a point every 60 seconds (for example), that&#39;s actually a suggestion rather than an imperative, and so the time interval between GPS points is never guaranteed. GPSLogger has logic that checks the time difference, though, and will make sure that at least 60 seconds have passed before logging again.  It is not meant for sub-second logging, as that will require aggressive wakelocks.</p>

<p>As of newer versions of Android, removing the notification will cause the service to be killed. As a result, the notification now needs to stay there. You may have seen a recent increase in the number of apps that need to sit in the notification bar for the same reason - to perform background services without being killed.  </p>
<p>There is an option in the app&#39;s settings that allows you to remove the notification buttons if you want a smaller notification.  </p>

<p>Due to the varied nature of the way task managers and task killers work, I simply cannot help or advise with any problems where you have one of these installed, and <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/166140/you-dont-need-to-install-a-task-manager-how-to-manage-running-apps-on-android/">would advise against it as well</a></p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="howisthisdifferentfromotherloggingapps" href="#howisthisdifferentfromotherloggingapps">How is this different from other logging apps?</a></h2><p>It&#39;s meant to be more battery efficient. A lot of other apps, such as MyTracks, usually go with the assumption that you have a data connection available and your routes won&#39;t be very long. They use CPU wakelocks and log points extremely frequently with high accuracy. The aim of GPSLogger is to log points and stay quiet.  </p>
<p>To put it another way, MyTracks or similar are better suited for runs; GPSLogger is suited for days out, hiking, photography.</p>

For example, in Tasker, create a new action under Misc &gt; Send Intent. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action: <code>com.mendhak.gpslogger.GpsLoggingService</code><br>Extra: <code>immediatestart:true (others below)</code><br>Target: <code>Service</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the extras you can send to GPSLogger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>immediatestart</code> - (true/false) Start logging immediately  </p>
<p><code>immediatestop</code> - (true/false) Stop logging</p>
<p><code>setnextpointdescription</code> - (text) Sets the annotation text to use for the next point logged</p>
<p><code>settimebeforelogging</code> - (number) Sets preference for time before logging option  </p>
<p><code>setdistancebeforelogging</code> - (number) Sets preference for distance before logging option</p>
<p><code>setkeepbetweenfix</code> - (true/false) Sets preference whether to keep GPS on between fixes</p>
<p><code>setretrytime</code> - (number) Sets preference for retry time</p>
<p><code>setabsolutetimeout</code> - (number) Sets preference for absolute timeout</p>
<p><code>setprefercelltower</code> - (true/false) Enables or disables the GPS or celltower listeners</p>
<p><code>logonce</code> - (true/false) Log a single point, then stop</p>
<p><code>switchprofile</code> - (text) The name of the profile to switch to</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="howcanidefineapresetfilewithmyownvalues" href="#howcanidefineapresetfilewithmyownvalues">How can I define a preset file with my own values?</a></h2><p>Many people actually distribute GPSLogger to colleagues preinstalled on phones, with some preset values. </p>
<p>If you create a file in the default folder or at <code>/sdcard/gpslogger.properties</code>, then GPSLogger will read this file each time it loads and apply those settings to the application. </p>
<p>For example, in the file you can put <code>accuracy_before_logging=42</code> and that will reset the <em>Accuracy Filter</em> to 42 meters each time the application starts. There are many properties that can be applied and you can glean a <a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/blob/master/gpslogger/src/main/java/com/mendhak/gpslogger/common/PreferenceNames.java">full list here</a>.</p>
<p>The most common examples of properties would be <code>log_gpx</code>, <code>log_kml</code>, <code>time_before_logging</code>, <code>opengts_*</code> for OpenGTS settings, <code>smtp_*</code> for email settings.</p>

<p>A common use case is to geotag photos.  Many cameras, especially SLRs, don&#39;t have built-in GPS.  After a day (or days) out of photography, you may have hundreds of photos that need to be geotagged so that their locations can appear properly when used elsewhere.  </p>
<p>I have had success with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geosetter.de/en/">GeoSetter</a> - GUI, comprehensive options with map display</li>
<li><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/599395/how-can-i-batch-tag-several-hundred-photos-with-separately-recorded-gps-data">ExifTool</a> - command line, lots of options</li>

<p> There are of course other uses of the produced files, these are a few I&#39;ve seen over the years; it&#39;s usually a combination of a log file produced from GPSLogger with a secondary software to process the files.  </p>

<p>Profiles are basically different settings, grouped under a name. For example you can have a <em>night</em> profile and a <em>trekking</em> profile with different logging frequencies, and switch between the two when you need to.</p>
<p>Tap the profile header and then &quot;Add profile&quot; to create a new profile. The new profile will have the same settings as the one you&#39;re currently on.  You can then modify a few settings and those should be specific to your new profile.</p>
<p>Conversely, any settings you change in one profile won&#39;t automatically be saved in other <em>existing</em> profiles.  It is recommended that you do your basic setup in the <em>Default Profile</em> first.  </p>
<p>You can delete a profile by long pressing it.</p>

<p>You can then grab the file off your phone and have a look through it, or email it to yourself from the same screen (<em>Attach debug log to email</em>).  Be sure to turn it off afterwards as this file grows very fast.   </p>
